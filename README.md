This is  a travel destinations review website that supports user log-in, posting reviews and comments, and editing previous submissions using Node.js and JavaScript.
Created MongoDB infrastructure to store reviews data and relevant information associated with users and sites. MapBox was used to get the locations of the destinations, and on the websiteâ€™s home page, a Cluster Map is
created, which gives an overview of all the places at which our destinations are present on a global map.
